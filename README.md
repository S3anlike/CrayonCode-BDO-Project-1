Works ONLY in Fullscreen Windowed Mode, windowed mode bugs now because there's too many icons on the top.

## FOR PROCESSING ENTHUSIASTS:

Run CrayonCode_Processing.au3 to start the script.

Requirements:
* Storage auto-arrange must be turned **ON**.
* Inventory auto-arrange must be turned **OFF** with the first 4 inventory slots EMPTY or with non-character bound items.
* SAVE settings after any changes otherwise they won't apply!
* All QUESTS from the NPC must be accepted and COMPLETED prior! BECAREFUL OF DAILY QUESTS THEY WILL BUG THE BOT.
* If using new UI, you must switch back to old UI by clicking this button:

For custom processing, use round numbers for BATCH and MAX. Basically the bot will do #MAX of #BATCH items. So if MAX was 100, and BATCH was 10, it will do 10 rounds of 10 items.
For example: You have 3651 Birch Lumber, BATCH would be 500, MAX 3500. 

This feature is still under development and might bug.
