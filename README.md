Discussion and older versions can be found at https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/black-desert/4268940-autoit-crayoncode-bot-project-opensource-free.html

## FOR PROCESSING ENTHUSIASTS:

Run CrayonCode_Processing.au3 to start the script.

Requirements:
* Storage auto-arrange must be turned **ON**.
* Inventory auto-arrange must be turned **OFF** with the first 4 inventory slots EMPTY or with non-character bound items.
* SAVE settings after any changes otherwise they won't apply!
* All QUESTS from the NPC must be accepted prior!

For custom processing, use round numbers for BATCH and MAX. Basically the bot will do #MAX of #BATCH items. So if MAX was 100, and BATCH was 10, it will do 10 rounds of 10 items.
For example: You have 3651 Birch Lumber, BATCH would be 500, MAX 3500. 

This feature is still under development and might bug.

Any issues please report to the discord at: https://discord.gg/hj6jPrW

## FOR MARKETPLACE SNIPING ENTHUSIASTS:

Run CrayonCode_MP.au3 to start the script.

Requirements:
* Marketplace must be open on a specific item, image for reference: https://i.gyazo.com/f243cf942bf5031fd53f1fc62abb2c96.png

This feature is also a WIP and might not work as intended, and as such testers as appreciated.

Known issues:

* When there's a item in the bid phase and the next BUY item is much more expensive the bot will keep trying to buy it while waiting for the next phase.
